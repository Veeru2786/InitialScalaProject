/* 1.Tuples are not a collection because it never have  methods map , filters , this is container where we store different different  item in same container.
2. we just need to put some elements inside parentheses, and you have a tuple. Scala tuples can contain between two and 22 items, and theyâ€™re useful for those times when you just need to combine a few things together
3.If there is no element present, it is called empty tuple.
